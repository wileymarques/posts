# Micro Front-ends With Angular Elements

## Summary

Micro Front-Ends (or MFE) is a hot topic at the moment. In this course, you will use one of the simplest solutions to this architecture, Angular Elements.

In this course, you will see what is Micro Front-Ends, some strategies for this kind of architecture, and how to implement it using Angular Elements.
