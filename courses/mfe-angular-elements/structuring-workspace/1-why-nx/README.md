Before we start using Nx, it's important to know what it is.

Nx is one of the more innovative tools for building web applications nowadays. It's vastly inspired in the Angular CLI and brings most of its benefits.

Different than the Angular CLI, Nx can handle almost any technology available for app development. Its open-source model and extensibility through plugins bring a variety of possible technologies to be used. Not only Angular projects can benefit from it, but also React, VueJS, or even those built using Vanilla JS.

With its built-in monorepo support, Nx will help us create the project we'll build together in this course. Since we'll deal not only with Angular but some other technologies, a tool like Nx is especially crucial.

Using the Nx CLI we will be able to create, run and build all the projects in this course.
